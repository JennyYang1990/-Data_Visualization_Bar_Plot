# -Data_Visualization_Bar_Plot
##A bar graph is a graphical representation of data in which we can highlight the category with particular shapes like a rectangle. 
The length and heights of the bar chart represent the data distributed in the dataset. In a bar chart, we have one axis representing a particular category of a column in the dataset and another axis representing the values or counts associated with it.  
Bar charts can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is often called a column chart. When we arrange bar charts in a high to low-value counts manner, we called them Pareto charts.
